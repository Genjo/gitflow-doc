Tools
-----

Well, I do use `vim <http://www.vim.org/>`_ to code, and the `git extension <https://github.com/nvie/gitflow>`_ to manage my worflow; even if some vim plugins exists; I do not use them.

Anyways, if you use a tool that implements git-flow natively or with a plugin; feel free to open a PR on the current doc!
